                    <ol>
                        <li>In your course, navigate to 'Rubrics' in the course menu on the left side.</li>
                        <li>In the top right, click 'Import rubric'.</li>
                        <li>Upload your CSV file.</li>
                        <li>After a moment, it should successfully import. You will see it appear in your rubrics list
                            as a draft.</li>
                        <li>Click the three dots '...' on the right of your imported rubric and click 'Edit'.</li>
                        <li>Click 'Save Rubric'. You can now add it to an assignment.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>To add your rubric to an assignment:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Navigate to 'Assignments' in the course menu on the left side.</li>
                        <li>Open an assignment.</li>
                        <li>Click 'Find Rubric'.</li>
                        <li>Select your rubric and click '+ Add'. If it doesn't appear in the list, follow the
                            instructions above to save your draft rubric.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>If you cannot see your rubric in the 'Find a rubric' list, make sure that your rubric is not
                        still a draft. Refresh the assignment page. If you still cannot see it, try duplicating the
                        rubric and see if the copy appears.</p>

                    <h3>How are points calculated?</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-content">
                    <p>Using the following rules:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>HD: 100% - 85% of the max points for the criterion.</li>
                        <li>D: 85% - 75% of the max points for the criterion.</li>
                        <li>C: 75% - 65% of the max points for the criterion.</li>
                        <li>P: 65% - 50% of the max points for the criterion.</li>
                        <li>F: &lt;50% of the max points for the criterion.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>There is a 0.01 points 'gap' between each level. For example, if a given criterion is worth 50%
                        of the marks, then a top score is 50 points, the low end of HD is 42.5 points, and the high end
                        of D is 42.49 points.</p>
                    <p>Please note: As of 14/2/25, Canvas has a bug where decimal points <strong>will not
                            import</strong> and instead are truncated to their floor values (i.e. 10.9 or 10.1 both
                        become 10). This bug has been fixed but not yet pushed out in an update. Until that happens,
                        please manually adjust the points after importing your rubric.</p>

                    <p>Specifically, it retrieves all tables between the "* Assessment Rubric" and "* Course Content

                    <p>Canvas does not support rich text in rubrics. Bold, italics and underlines are discarded, while

                <div class="faq-content">
                    <p>Because Canvas does not support this. They used to. But now they don't. I don't know why.</p>
                    <p>Kangarubric has been developed to support new lines in criteria descriptions as soon as Canvas
                        supports this again. It's currently operating in a 'compatibility mode' of sorts, which will be
                        turned off once this change is made in a future Canvas update.</p>
                    <p>In the meantime, there's nothing you can do about it. Sorry.</p>

                <div class="faq-content">
                    <p>Since criterion names share a cell with the description we cannot reliably tell where the name
                        ends and the description begins. You can edit the names manually either in Kangarubric or in
                        Canvas.</p>

                <div class="faq-content">
                    <p>While this shouldn't happen, it is possible.</p>
                    <p>Kangarubric only expects to find paragraph text and lists in any rubric table cell. If your
                        rubric contains any other content (such as images or hyperlinks), it probably won't work. Canvas
                        doesn't support anything other than plain text anyway.</p>
                    <p>If you you don't think there's anything wrong with your course details form and you are still
                        having problems with Kangarubric, please email the word document, CSV file (if possible) and a
